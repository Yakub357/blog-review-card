## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Hover effect
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I refreshed how to use @media-queries together with hover effect animations.
Building simple layout with flexbox and grid properties of CSS.

### Continued development

I would add more interaction animations besides hovering effect, e.g. fade-in animation when the page is just rendered and some other dynamic animations giving this card more life.
